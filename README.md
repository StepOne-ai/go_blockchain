## Overview üåç

This project provides a simple, efficient, and highly extensible **blockchain framework** written in **Golang**, tailored specifically for **Web3** applications. Whether you're building decentralized applications (dApps), creating a new cryptocurrency, or exploring new consensus mechanisms, this blockchain offers the flexibility and speed you need for your next Web3 project.

With its fast performance and easy-to-understand design, it aims to make blockchain technology more accessible and enable developers to focus on innovation rather than complex infrastructure.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

- **Peer-to-Peer Network**: Decentralized communication between nodes for secure transaction broadcasting.
- **Decentralized Ledger**: A tamper-proof, distributed ledger storing all blocks and transactions.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Implements a custom proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.
- **Smart Contracts**: Easily integrates with smart contracts written in Solidity or a Golang-based contract system.
- **Transactions**: Full support for validating and verifying transactions, including crypto transactions and token transfers.
- **Node Discovery**: Automatic peer node discovery for easy network scaling.
- **Web3 Compatibility**: Built for seamless interaction with existing Web3 tools like MetaMask, Web3.js, and more.
- **Customizable**: You can modify and extend the blockchain's core functionality to suit your needs.
- **Secure and Fast**: Optimized for high throughput with a focus on security, decentralization, and scalability.

## Technologies Used üíª

This blockchain framework is built with the following technologies:

- **Go (Golang)**: The main language for system-level functionality and performance.
- **Libp2p**: Used for peer-to-peer networking and communication.
- **Golang concurrency**: Leverages Go's goroutines and channels for efficient parallel processing.
- **Ethereum Web3 Protocol**: For integration with dApps and other Web3 tools.
- **Crypto Libraries**: Using Go‚Äôs cryptographic libraries for secure hashing, encryption, and wallet management.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with the blockchain system, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Go version 1.18+ (`go version`)
- Git (`git version`)

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golang-blockchain-web3.git
cd golang-blockchain-web3
```

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary Go dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### Build the Blockchain

To build the blockchain system, use the following command:

```bash
go build -o blockchain
```

### Run the Blockchain

Start the blockchain node by running:

```bash
./blockchain
```

By default, the node will run on port `5000`. You can change the configuration by editing the `config.json` file.

## Usage üìà

Once the blockchain is running, you can interact with it via the HTTP API or directly through the Go client.

### Example: Sending a Transaction

You can send a transaction from one node to another by using a simple API request. Below is an example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:5000/transaction \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "from": "address1",
    "to": "address2",
    "amount": 10
}'
```

This will broadcast the transaction to all peers in the network and record it in the blockchain once validated.

## API Documentation üìÑ

For detailed API documentation on interacting with the blockchain, refer to the [API Docs](docs/api.md). It includes endpoints for:

- Node management (start, stop, synchronize)
- Transaction creation, signing, and broadcasting
- Block retrieval and querying
- Smart contract execution and interaction

## Smart Contract Integration üìú

This blockchain supports the integration of **smart contracts** using a Go-based interpreter or by interfacing with existing **Solidity** smart contracts via Ethereum compatibility.

### Deploying Smart Contracts

You can deploy and interact with smart contracts using the following example Go code:

```go
// Example: Deploying a contract
contract, err := blockchain.DeployContract("MyContract", contractBytecode)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Failed to deploy contract:", err)
}

// Interact with the contract
result, err := blockchain.ExecuteContract(contractAddress, "myMethod", params)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Failed to execute contract:", err)
}
```

This allows seamless Web3 integration for managing decentralized applications directly on your blockchain.
